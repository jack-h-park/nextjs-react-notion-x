# PostHog alerts (archived)

This implementation guide has moved into `docs/telemetry/posthog-ops.md`, which now covers the PostHog dashboard tiles, Alert A/B configuration, plan constraints, cooldowns, and the cache hit/miss fallback strategy. Please update `posthog-ops.md` when you change thresholds or add new insights.
