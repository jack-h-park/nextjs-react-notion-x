# Operations Documentation

This folder houses the operational runbooks, checklists, and audits that keep the chat/telemetry platform healthy in day-to-day and incident contexts. Treat these docs as the practical counterpart to the telemetry contracts in `docs/telemetry/`.

Key files:

- `telemetry-audit-checklist.md` — operational checklist for telemetry invariants and audit procedures.
- `local-llm-operations-checklist.md` — operational guidance for the local LLM routing matrix.
- `../telemetry/runbooks/oncall-runbook.md` — the on-call playbooks for Alerts A, B, and C.
